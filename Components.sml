		Guys. seriously this is what you had writen:

		int is a type! and should for ever and always be nothing more than just that.

(*
The reason for using the placeholder structures Register and Stack is because signatures can't "inherit" from eachother.
I can not write say REGISTER.reg in the PROGRAM_COUNTER signature.
There is the include keyword but that just adds all of the declarations from another signature. Thus specifying that the 
signature containing the include must when its used in a structure allso include all of the functions and values in the included
signature.
