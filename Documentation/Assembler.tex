\title{Assembler documentation}

\section{General}
The VM features a very basic assembler capable of little more than adress
resolution. But yet it gives us an ability to create some neat little programs.
\section{Syntax}
The syntax for the assembly code is pretty straight forward. Each declaration is
written on a single line. There are a few reserved identifiers:

\begin{tabular}{|c | c| c |}
\hline
Indentifier & Name & Description\\
\hline
\V+%<text>+ & Comment  & Will be ignored by the assembler\\
\hline
\V+#<name>+ & Label & Declares a label called \V+<name>+ \\
\hline
\V+@<name>+ & Value & Declares a value called \V+<name>+\\
\hline
\V+:<data>+ & Raw input & Returns \V+<data>+ as is \\
\hline
\verb+$+ & Address & Treats \V+a+ as a address \\
\hline
\V+x+ & x & The \x \ register \\
\hline
\V+y+ & y & The \y \ register \\
\hline
\V+s+ & s & The stack \s \\
\hline
\V+q1+ & IRQ1 & The \q \ register\\
\hline
\V+q2+ & IRQ2 & The \qq \ register\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\\
\\
The names given to labels and values can contain any characters except for
whitespace ones.\\
Operations are declared in a straightforward approach as:\\
\V+<opcode> <arg1> <arg2>+ \\
Wich arguments are allowed are dependent upon the opcode.\\


\section{Usage}
\subsection{Registers}
The useage of the registers is pretty straight forward. One has to remeber that
\V+q1+ and \V+q2+ are write only registers and that \V+s+ cant be used for
addressing so \verb+$s+ is not allowed and will generate a \verb+syntax+ error.
It is also good to keep in mind that all operations reading from the stack will
consume what is on top of the stack.

\subsection{Pointers}
Using pointers is fairly straight forward. Alltough one has to keep in mind how
the addresses are resolved. All pointers will be resolved after the
tokenazation fo the code. First the labels will be resolved and then the values.
This means that the first value will lie after the last line of code. Since the
address of a label depends on where in the code their addresses are easy to
reason about. However for values things are bit different. Since vlues will be
given addresses wich are ``independent'' of where in the code they appear it is
hard to reason about the address of a value. Although the value pointers are
resolved in order the first value declared whill lie intermediatley after the
last line of code and the last value declared will lie ``at the end'' of the
memmory used by the program. This can be exploited to use rellative addressing.
Allthoug great care has to be taken.

Its important to remember that all pointers are reffered to troughout the entire
program therefor it's not allowed to define two pointers with the same name. If
this where to be allowed it would generate unpredictable behaviour so instead
the assembler will return a \V+assembler+ error.

Labels and values are interchangable. Since opcodes takes pointers as arguments
and has no idea weather or not they are labels or values. From this the need for
caution arises. Since one can use value pointers as arguments to jump operation
like this:
\begin{verbatim}
@bad_idea
ADD x y
MOV s x
MUL x y
JMP bad_idea
\end{verbatim}
Since it is not known what where \V+bad_idea+ points jumping to it is suicidal.

Since pointers are just numbers under the hood one needs to take into account
weather or not one uses them for their adress orr for their values. Here is some
examples
\begin{verbatim}
@pointer
% This stores x in pointer
MOV x value
% This stroes x in the address wich is
% stored at pointer
MOV x $value
% This adds one to the value stored at 
% pointer
ADD $pointer 1
% This adds one to the address of pointer
ADD pointer 1
\end{verbatim}

Pointers are imutable and once they has been declared they can not be changed.
One has to do some tricking to achive relative addressing using labels or
values.


\subsubsection{Labels}
Labels are declared using the \V+#+ identifier.
Labels are resolved first and their addresses
correspond to location in the code where they are written. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
MOV x y
#loop
INC x
MOV x s
JMP loop
\end{verbatim}
In this code \V+loop+ points to the address where \V+INC x+ is stored. In the
tokenization of the assembly code the lines where a pointer is defined will be
ignored and the address where the next instruction or raw entry occurs. This can
lead to that poorly written code becomes ambigous. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
MOV x y
#loop
#silly
INC y
\end{verbatim}
Here \V+loop+ and \V+silly+ will both point to the same address wich is silly.

Because tokenaization of the code happens before the address resolving a label
will be ``in scope'' troughout the enitre code. So this code is perfectly valid:

\begin{verbatim}
MOV x y
JMP ahead
INC x
ADD x y
#ahead
ADD s x
\end{verbatim}
The \V+JMP ahead+ will jump to \V+ADD s x+ even though the \V+ahead+ flag is
defined after the jump. This was not a concious design choise but it is actually
quite usefull since one can define subroutines anywhere in the code wich can be
accesed form anywhere in the code.\\
One possible piffall arises due to the fact that the assembler does not know the
difference between a label and a value after their adresses has been resolved.
So this code is valid assembly code:
\begin{verbatim}
#loop
ADD s x
MOV s $loop
JMP loop
\end{verbatim}
Allthough what this will do is that it will change what is at the address of
\V+loop+. But there \V+ADD s x+ lies! This is what is known as self-modifiying
code and it's the spawn of satan and should be avoided like one avoids Miami
beach during spring break. Allthough in some cases the interchangability of
value and label can be verry usefull if one wants to have ``arrays'' in ones
code. This is easily achived like this:
\begin{verbatim}
#array
:0
:1
:2
:3
\end{verbatim}
Here \V+array+ can be used as a pointer to the array. One can then manipulate
the array trough using rellative arressing of \V+array+ like this:
\begin{verbatim}
ADD 2 array
MOV s y
MOV 5 $y
#array
:0
:1
:2
:3
\end{verbatim}
This code would change the 2 into a 5. But great care needs to be taken since
one could easily end up outside of the ``array'' and corrupt the program.
