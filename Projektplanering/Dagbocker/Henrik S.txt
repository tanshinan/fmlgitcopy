	Created a Utilities structure for handling I/O.
	Encountered severe problems writing text to files.
		Posted stack exchange question about it but
		being a rookie i then found the answer on my
		own.
		The online documentation for TEXT_IO is very vague
		and slightly misleading. But i answered my own question
		and detailed the solution here:

	Whilst the other kids are out getting drunk and having sex
	I just finished the assembler :P
		There is room for some improvement still.
	Also took backup of entire project in case someone screws up with git.
	Did some changes to the VM specs. Renamed the conditional jumping to
	branching. Its what I'm used to from the C64.
