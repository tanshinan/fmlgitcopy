	Started working on the address resolution for the VM.

	Assembler now does address resolution for labels.
	
21/2 10:30
	Added support for empty lines to the Assembler.
	Finalized the specs.
	Wrote specification regarding the implementation of the VM.

	Assembler now does full address resolution.
	
21/2 17:00
	Added support for raw data entry.
	
21/2 21:58
	Created a Utilities structure for handling I/O.
	Encountered severe problems writing text to files.
		Posted stack exchange question about it but
		being a rookie i then found the answer on my
		own.
		The online documentation for TEXT_IO is very vague
		and slightly misleading. But i answered my own question
		and detailed the solution here:

	Whilst the other kids are out getting drunk and having sex
	I just finished the assembler :P
		There is room for some improvement still.
	Also took backup of entire project in case someone screws up with git.
	Did some changes to the VM specs. Renamed the conditional jumping to
	branching. Its what I'm used to from the C64.

	Assembler now checks for duplicate pointers

	Wrote signatures for the specific components of the VM in order to help the other get on with
	the implementation. Although ran in to some confusing and annoying problems with the module system.
	Another reason why SML rhymes with FML

	Did some formating for the Specs file.
	Rewrote some of the Componenets.sml
	Created a VM.sml file containing signatures.

	Started work on the assembler documentation.
	Started writing a more complicated test assembler case and found some bugs in the assembler.
		Those bugs have now been fixed.
	Found a serious case of ambiguity in the VM specification. Clarified things.
	
24/2 12:54
	Had a little meting with the crew. Discussed VM implementation, and some misc stuff.

25/2 18:17
	Looked trough the changes made to the Components.sml file and made some changes and commented on some things.
	Continued working on the assembler documentation.
